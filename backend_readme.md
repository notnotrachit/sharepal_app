    "split_type": "equal",
    "splits": [
      {"user_id": "<user1-id>", "amount": 0},
      {"user_id": "<user2-id>", "amount": 0},
      {"user_id": "<user3-id>", "amount": 0}
    ],
    "category": "Food"
  }'
```

### 4. Check Balances
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/<group-id>/balances \
  -H "Bearer-Token: <your-jwt-token>"
```

### 5. Simplify Debts
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/groups/<group-id>/simplify \
  -H "Bearer-Token: <your-jwt-token>"
```

## Expense Split Types

### Equal Split
Everyone pays the same amount:
```json
{
  "split_type": "equal",
  "splits": [
    {"user_id": "user1", "amount": 0},
    {"user_id": "user2", "amount": 0}
  ]
}
```

### Exact Amount Split
Specify exact amounts:
```json
{
  "split_type": "exact",
  "splits": [
    {"user_id": "user1", "amount": 30.00},
    {"user_id": "user2", "amount": 20.00}
  ]
}
```

### Percentage Split
Split by percentage (must total 100%):
```json
{
  "split_type": "percentage",
  "splits": [
    {"user_id": "user1", "amount": 60},
    {"user_id": "user2", "amount": 40}
  ]
}
```

## Balance Calculation

The API automatically calculates balances for each user:
- **Positive balance**: Others owe you money
- **Negative balance**: You owe others money
- **Zero balance**: You're settled up

## Debt Simplification

The smart debt simplification algorithm minimizes the number of transactions needed to settle all debts within a group. For example, if:
- Alice owes Bob $10
- Bob owes Charlie $10

The algorithm suggests: Alice pays Charlie $10 (eliminating the need for Bob to be involved).
